        <p>Growing up as an <em>Asian kid</em> with extreme expectations from the most homest parent ever, I knew I had the <strong>family's presure</strong> all over my soul and every site that I go to. Since I was born, I have to represent my family for other relatives, I have to represent the nerd in my school, I have to represent the <strong><em>men</em></strong> between men, and even represent the Chineses in my mother country. <em>When can I represent <strong>myself</strong>?</em></p>
        
        <p>Due to all the <em><strong>parental</strong></em> <strong>expectations</strong> that you can think of and you cannot imagine, my family finally came down to a conclusion, which I felt <em>homeless</em> when they first told me. They came up with a brilliant idea of sending me abroad for my futher studies. For me, studing abroad is definately the golden <em>liberty</em> to scape the old teaching and seek for my dream. Specially, atteding high school in <strong>"the country of liberty"</strong></p>
        
        <p>My emotions at that moment was sort of neutral. Even tough of all the sadness and the fear of missing family and one of the most genuine classmates, the excitement and anxiousness to meet a <strong>new</strong> and <strong>exotic</strong> world kind of cancel out. Surprisingly before my departure, my fellow classmates made a expedition party for me. That remark was THE CELEBRATION that I never have before. This is one of those unforgetable remembrances in my life.</p>

        <p>I was not alone in this journey. My dad actually came with me for three month. For me, he just stay that long to confirm if I have the survival skills. In the negative case, he will just drag me back to Brazil preventing my death in a foreing country. At that moment, I had quite a oposition against my dad that I do not even want to think about going back with him to Brazil.</p>
        
        <p>I know that there are many people like me traversing oversea to get weather experiences or knowledge. I wish my case could be different just to be special. But that is hard specially with Asian parents.</p>
        
        <p>My first impression standing in the US was liberty. I was not sure what made me feel that way, maybe it is because of "The Liberty Godness"</p>
